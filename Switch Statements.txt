Like if and else statements but Switch statements are more streamlined. 
Switch statements deal with numbers and constants, or multiple if/then statements. 
If you are going to nest more than 2/3 if/ else statments don't. Use a Switch statment. 
public class ConversationScript ; MonoBehaviour
Void Greet
  switch (___________)
  case #
     print ("whatever you want to print")
     break;
on and on until lowest _______
default; 
print (__________)
break;

This can be used with intelligence levels in video games (actions, do they attack? do
they try to be diplomatic?), test/quiz scores, conversations,
choosing what to do with something (if you find a weapon, what do you do with it?)
like in mass effect or skyrim, what you do effects the story. are there multiple consequences? 
use a Switch statment.
